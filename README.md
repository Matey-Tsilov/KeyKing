# KeyKing
 CONTENTS OF THIS FILE
---------------------

 * Introduction

This is my first project as a junior full stack developer.
With this project I want to represent one of my wishes, which is connected to fast-typing. We all know how cool it looks and feels when we hear that noise, comming from the keyboardwhich belongs to the person sitting near us. 

This application will help you develop your typing skill even further. 

 * Main goal

The main goal is to combine both fun, and hard work. With KeyKing you can learn to type faster and on top of that it will be amusing to accomplish all of those achievements.

 2. run cd client -> then npm i -> then npm start (in order to start the web application)
 3. run cd server -> then npm start (to start the surver and connect with the dataBase)
 4. Have fun
