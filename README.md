 * Introduction

This is my first project as a junior full stack developer.
With this project I want to represent one of my wishes, which is connected to fast-typing. We all know how cool it looks and feels when we hear that noise, comming from the keyboardwhich belongs to the person sitting near us. 

This application will help you develop your typing skill even further.
